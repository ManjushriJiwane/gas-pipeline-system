pipes used for transmission of lpg:
Both PVC and polyethylene (PE) pipes can be used for pipes
 that are buried in the ground outside a building. 
You'll also find ductile iron pipes, 
yellow brass pipes and aluminum pipes that 
can be used in different situations.
 Approved flexible connectors are used for 
connecting gas lines to appliances.

pipe natural gas vs. lpg:
Piped Natural Gas is methane. 
It is much lighter when compared to LPG.
 PNG is also flammable. Since it is also lighter
 than air and has a high dispersion rate than LPG,
 it is not as hazardous as LPG in case of a leakage.

past and future of project:
Previous methods of detecting leaks relied heavily
 on human intervention and calculating pressure drops
 to determine if and where a pipeline may be leaking.
 While these methods offer valuable detection techniques,
 pipeline operators today are moving toward digitized 
processes that involve wireless electronic systems as
 well as more complete integrity management systems to
 provide a higher level of pipeline safety and leak prevention.
